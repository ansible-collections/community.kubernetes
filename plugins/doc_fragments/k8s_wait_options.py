    - Implemented for C(state=present) for C(Deployment), C(DaemonSet) and C(Pod), and for C(state=absent) for all resource kinds.
    - For resource kinds without an implementation, C(wait) returns immediately unless C(wait_condition) is set.
    default: no
    type: bool
  wait_sleep:
    description:
    - Number of seconds to sleep between checks.
    default: 5

        - The possible types for a condition are specific to each resource type in Kubernetes.
        - See the API documentation of the status field for a given resource to see possible choices.
      status:
        type: str
        description:
        - The value of the status field in your desired condition.
